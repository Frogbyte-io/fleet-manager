# Proxmox capacity response fixtures

These bounded, secret-free JSON response fixtures are representative, synthetic
PVE 8.x and 9.x responses for the FM-915 contract tests. They are not live API
captures. Endpoint fields and units follow the upstream
`/nodes/{node}/status` and `/nodes/{node}/storage` implementations in
[`pve-manager`](https://github.com/proxmox/pve-manager/blob/master/PVE/API2/Nodes.pm)
and [`pve-storage`](https://github.com/proxmox/pve-storage/blob/master/src/PVE/API2/Storage/Status.pm).
Values and host names are synthetic so the fixtures contain no environment data.

The test transport verifies the request paths and normalized values. A real
PVE 8.x/9.x integration run remains the compatibility gate before claiming
live-cluster validation. The PVE 9 memory example includes buffers and cache
in the remainder between `used`, `free`, and `total`, reflecting PVE's
cache-excluding `used` calculation.
